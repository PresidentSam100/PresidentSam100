ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I want to make sure you are in the right place. This is the GitHub profile of Sam Lu: A current student at the University of Texas at Austin :D

What I'm currently working on right now and hope to complete this summer:
1. Coding a personal website - (I procrastinated too much on this lol)
2. Building an iOS mobile app using Swift
3. Designing a one-button game for [Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS)](https://discord.gg/rREcZd72Az)
4. Creating a data visualization to showoff my Tableau talents, my SQL specialties, and my R rizz
5. Working on many other smaller side projects

Feel free to follow my GitHub, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samblu/) @samblu or reach out through my [Email](mailto:samlu@utexas.edu)
