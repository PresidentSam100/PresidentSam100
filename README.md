ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I want to make sure you are in the right place. This is the GitHub profile of Sam Lu: A current student at the University of Texas at Austin

What I'm currently working on right now and hope to complete this summer:
1. Coding a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (cuz I procrastinated way too much on this lol).
2. Building an Swift iOS mobile app that helps people stop forgetting personal belonings.
3. Designing a one-button game for [Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS)](https://discord.gg/rREcZd72Az).
4. Creating a data visualization to showoff my Tableau talents, my SQL specialties, and my R rizz.
5. Doing some LeetCode/NeedCode/AlgoExpert/ProgramExpert questions to prep for technical interviews.
6. Working on many other smaller side projects with other languages I know.

Stuff I have worked on in the past:
1. MyBuddy: A mobile app that helps aid people with autism in social interactions using deep learning techniques.
2. Data Structures Honors (CS314H) projects like Tetris, Boggle, and Web Scraper for my college (Private as per course syllabus)
3. Many Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematical Models that showcase various scientific phenomenon in real-time.
4. A few research case studies on various tragedies like the Titanic sinking and a pandemic that shall not be named.
5. Some Java video game stuff (Note: please use Unity and C# for game development, it's 10x better)
6. Competitive Programming code solutions from some HS programming contests like Code Quest and Battle of the Brains.
