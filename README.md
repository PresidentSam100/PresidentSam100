👋 Greetings! I want to make sure you are in the right place. This is the GitHub profile of Sam Lu: A current student at the University of Texas at Austin :D

👨‍💻 I'm deeply passionate about the application of technologies in business, quantitative finance, socioeconomics, and education and how they can improve people's lives.

🖥️ I'm especially interested in exploring the fields of SWE/SDE, Quant, AI/ML, Data Science, Fintech, Biotech, Cybersecurity, and Game Development during my undergraduate years.

🏫 At school, I can be seen leading outreach for the Electronic Game Developers Society, helping students in multivariable calculus as a teaching assistant, or designing a cool rocket for Longhorn Rocketry Association.

😁 Outside of school, I enjoy playing table tennis, exploring the cities, trying out new restaurants (I’m open to any recommendations), and listening to epic video game songs.

✉️ Whether you're a recruiter, an experienced professional, or even a college student, I'd love to have a chat! Feel free to follow my GitHub, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samblu/) @samblu or reach out through my [Email](mailto:samlu@utexas.edu)
