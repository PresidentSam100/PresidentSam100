ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Sam Lu, and I'm a student at UT Austin majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/).

ðŸ“• I mostly work with Java, C#, C/C++, and Python, but I have experience with technologies like R, SQL, and Kotlin.

ðŸ’» I have worked at both large and small companies in technology related roles, building AI models, data visualizations, and mobile apps. 

âš™ I'm primarily interested in AI/ML, software engineering, and data science, but Iâ€™m also interested in exploring other fields such as cybersecurity and finance.

â˜Ž You can reach out to me by email at [samlu@utexas.edu](samlu@utexas.edu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samblu/) @samblu, and explore the rest of my projects here.
